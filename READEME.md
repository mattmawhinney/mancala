Mancala is a game of moving stones or pebbles around a playing board. It traces its roots
back as far as 1300 years to the regions of modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea. 

And, I used to play it when growing up. Here are the rules:


1. The Mancala 'board' is made up of two rows of six holes, or slots, each. 

2. Four pieces -- represented by "o"'s -- are placed in each of the 12 holes. 

3. Each player has a goal where they store their stones 

4. The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on his side.
   Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each hole until the stones run out 
5. If you run into your own store, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's store, skip it.

6. If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn.

7. If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the hole directly opposite.

8. Always place all captured pieces in your store.
9. The game ends when all six spaces on one side of the Mancala board are empty.

10. The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends captures all of those pieces.

11.Count all the pieces in each store. The winner is the player with the most pieces.
