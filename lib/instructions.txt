SETUP
2 players
start with an even distribution of stones 
4 stones in each of 12 "non-end-zone" slots on the game board
48 total stones 
Each player a side of the board
and an end-zone (to the right of their side from the player's persp.)
where they deposit their stones 

MOVING  & SCORING 
play starts with the player on the bottom side of the board
picking the stones from anyone of his/her 6 slots
then, moving counter-clockwise
the player deposits the stones 1 at a time
into the sucessive slots 

if the players depositing includes their own endzone
  they deposit the stone in their endzone 
if the depositing includes the other players endzone 
  they skip it and move on to the next slot(which is their own)

if the last piece a player deposits is in their own endzone 
  they get a free turn 
if the last piece they deposit is in an empty slot on their side
	they get all the pieces opposite that slot in their endzone 

barring a free turn, play alternates after every move 
use 

WINNING
Play stops when all the stones are cleared from one side of the board
The player with the greatest number of stones in his/her endzone at this 
point is the winner
